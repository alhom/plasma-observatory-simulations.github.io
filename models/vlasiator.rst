Vlasiator
=========

Vlasiator [1]_ [2]_ is a 6D ion-kinetic hybrid-Vlasov model for the Earth's global magnetosphere. Vlasiator simulates the dynamics of plasma using a hybrid-Vlasov model, where protons are described by their distribution function f(r,v,t) in ordinary (r) and velocity (v) space, and electrons are a charge-neutralising fluid. This approach neglects electron kinetic effects but retains ion kinetics. The time-evolution of f(r,v,t) is given by Vlasov's equation, which is coupled self-consistently to Maxwell's equations giving the evolution of the electric and magnetic fields E and B. Maxwell's equations neglect the displacement current. The equations are closed by a generalised Ohm's law including the Hall term.

Use cases
---------

Vlasiator has been used to describe magnetic reconnection in global magnetospheric context, especially in the magnetotail [3]_ and the kinetic features of the tail reconnection processes [4]_ [5]_ and the global evolution of flux transfer events [6]_.

Data availability
-----------------

Available data to be listed (public/on-request/available via collaboration).

Data access subject to `Rules of the Road <https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/vlasiator/rules-of-the-road>`_. Some data is available publicly.

Simulations-on-demand
---------------------

Global Vlasiator simulations take months to complete, and are not offered on an on-demand basis; larger collaborations can o fcourse be planned.

Small/local simulations can be set up and supported for external users on best-effort basis.

Numerical Methods
-----------------

Vlasiator propagates the distribution function forward in time with a conservative fifth-order accurate Semi-Lagrangian algorithm. This algorithm allows using long time steps even in the presence of strong magnetic fields, as the propagation in velocity space is not limited by the Courant-Friedrichs-Levy (CFL) condition. The field solver is a second-order accurate divergence-free upwind-constrained transport method.

Vlasiator has a parallel Cartesian mesh in ordinary space. In each spatial cell there is a 3-dimensional sparse velocity grid, modelling the in the full 6-dimensional distribution function. Empty velocity space cells are neither stored nor propagated, which in a typical case reduces the total number of phase space cells by a factor of at least 100 while impacting mass conservation to a relative level of no more than 10−6.

The ordinary space grid is implemented using the open source `DCCRG <https://github.com/fmihpc/dccrg>`_ grid library developed by the group. It is parallelized using MPI-based domain decomposition and OpenMP-based threading is used to further parallelise the work done by each process. The Vlasov solver is vectorised using AVX intrinsics. The load is balanced with the `Zoltan <http://www.cs.sandia.gov/zoltan/>`_ library using its recursive coordinate bisection partitioner. I/O is performed using our own parallel `VLSV <https://github.com/fmihpc/vlsv>`_ file format, which can be analyzed using VisIt or by using the Python-based `Analysator <https://github.com/fmihpc/analysator>`_ package.
